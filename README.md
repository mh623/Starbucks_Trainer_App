Description:
This app is intended to help new Starbucks baristas  in training with memorizing 
how to make beverages, beverage components, as well as a cheat sheet for the shelf 
life of different products.

Information was gathered from this source created by Starbucks employees:
https://sbuxdates.com

The app itself consists of a main activity with a title and three buttons with the
options of Standard Builds, Beverage Component Recipes, and Shelf Life Standards. 
Once a button is clicked, a new activity is started and the user is met with a 
Heading of the option they chose, and below that, a recycler view displaying the
products within that option’s field. Clicking on a product then displays the steps
on how to make the product or information on the product’s shelf life.
